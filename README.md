**Repository content:**

**CASE STUDIES - DATA FILES**

**case study 1 ratemap.rda**

The file contains:

1. data: data.frame with information on species and group
2. mshapeS: 3D surface of the consensus shape
3. pairedLM: landmarks and semilandmarks indices
4. refmat: landmarks and semilandmarks configurations used for the interpolation
5. refsur: 3D meshes used for the interpolation
6. slid: not-superimposed landmarks and semilandmarks configurations
7. tree: phylogenetic tree

**case study 2 convmap.rda**

The file contains:

1. data: data.frame with information on species and group
2. mshapeS: 3D surface of the consensus shape
3. pairedLM: landmarks and semilandmarks indices
4. refmat: landmarks and semilandmarks configurations to be used for the interpolation
5. refsur: 3D meshes to be used for the interpolation
6. slid: not-superimposed landmarks and semilandmarks configurations
7. tree: phylogenetic tree

**case study 3 convmap skull and endocast.rda**

The file contains:

1. data: data.frame with information on species and group
2. mshapeS_e: 3D surface of the endocasts consensus shape
3. mshapeS_c: 3D surface of the skulls consensus shape
4. pairedLM_e: landmarks and semilandmarks indices of endocasts configuration
5. pairedLM_c: landmarks and semilandmarks indices of skulls configuration
6. refmat: landmarks and semilandmarks configurations to be used for the interpolation
